\arguments{
\item{df}{Dataframe to clean, filter and tidy with respect to taxonomy.}

\item{taxa_col}{Character. Name of column with taxa.}

\item{context}{Character. Name of columns defining context.}

\item{extra_cols}{Character. Name of any extra columns to keep.}

\item{required_rank}{Character. Default is 'species'. What level of the
taxonomic hierarchy is required for results. Records above this level are
filtered.}

\item{do_cov}{Logical. Should cover (needs to be supplied in df) be appended
to output.}

\item{do_life}{Logical. Should lifeform (needs to be supplied in df) be
appended to output.}

\item{lucov}{Dataframe lookup for cover.}

\item{lulife}{Dataframe lookup for lifeform.}

\item{taxonomy}{list with (at least) named elements \code{lutaxa} and \code{taxonomy}.
Usually resulting from call to \code{envClean::make_taxonomy()}.}

\item{do_ind}{Logical. Should ind (needs to be supplied in df) be
appended to output.}
}
\value{
Dataframe with columns taxa, context and, possibly, extracols
, lifeform and cover
}
\description{
Deprecated in favour of the simpler workflow involving make_taxonomy then
bin_taxa (along with other bins, say, geographic and temporal). Required
attributes are then added to each taxa; context and/or taxa + context before
reducing to distinct context and associated attributes.
